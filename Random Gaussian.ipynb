The search carried out by this program, however, is not a valid proof. The sample size of 100,000 random vectors might not be a large enough sample to obtain an accurate result. Furthermore, the random vectors used in the calculation might not be a good representation of every vector in the subspace, so the result might not be the real maximum."],"metadata":{"id":"tBNUcGnn6Dhq"}}]}
